The User Management Application is used for user registration and authentication using JWT-based authentication. 
This application authenticates the user based on the JWT token. 
A `JwtAuthenticationFilter` is added in the `SecurityFilterChain` before the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` to authenticate the user based on the token; 
if the token is valid and not expired, the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` will treat the user as authenticated. 
If the user does not provide a token in the request header, the `JwtAuthenticationFilter` will skip processing and forward the request to the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`.
